# Create my own library in C - Libft
The Libft repo is a project to recreate several of the functions in the standard library. Recreating several functions has provided me with a deeper understanding of each functions behavior and the importance of devleoping a testing suit to ensure each function works properly. 

##Project outlook and concepts learned
1. Dynamically allocating memory 
2. Bit manipulation 
3. Creating linked lists. 
4. Implementation of Binary and Bubble Sort Algorithms 
5. Using gcc option flags for building and linking libraries
